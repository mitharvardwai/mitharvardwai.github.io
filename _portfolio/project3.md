Marinka Zitnik is an Assistant Professor at Harvard University with appointments in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Blavatnik Institute, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Harvard Data Science Initiative. Dr. Zitnik is a computer scientist studying applied machine learning, focusing on challenges brought forward by data in science, medicine, and health. Dr. Zitnik's research vision is that in the future artificial intelligence will be routinely used to give clinicians diagnostic recommendations; give scientists testable hypotheses they can confirm experimentally and offer them insights into safe and precise treatments; and give patients guidance on self-care, e.g., how to lead a healthy lifestyle and recognize the disease early. To realize this vision, her lab at Harvard develops methods for learning over complex data and translates machine learning research into innovative applications. Before joining Harvard, Dr. Zitnik was a postdoctoral fellow in Computer Science at Stanford University and was involved in projects at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Dr. Zitnik has recently been named a Rising Star in EECS by MIT and also a Next Generation in Biomedicine by the Broad Institute, being the only young scientist who received such recognition in both EECS and Biomedicine.
