Dr. Zoya Bylinskii is a Research Scientist at Adobe. Her work lies at the interface of human perception & cognition, computer vision & machine learning, and human computer interfaces. Zoya actively works on understanding and modeling human attention and memory, as well as on artificial intelligence for creativity. Before joining Adobe, she received her PhD from MIT in 2018, advised by Dr. Fredo Durand (computer graphics) and Dr. Aude Oliva (perception and cognition) at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Her thesis was on “Computational Perception for Multimodal Document Understanding” and was awarded the George M. Sprowls Award for Best PhD Theses in Computer Science. Zoya’s M.Sc. thesis, also from MIT, titled “Computational Understanding of Image Memorability” was supervised by Dr. Antonio Torralba and Dr. Aude Oliva. Prior to this, Zoya attended the University of Toronto, where she majored in computer science and statistics and was an undergraduate research assistant in computer vision, working on parts-based object recognition and sign language understanding.
