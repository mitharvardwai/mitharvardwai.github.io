Claudia Del Pozo is the Founder and Director of the Eon Resilience Lab at C Minds, a tech4impact agency based in San Francisco, Mexico City and Guadalajara. Via the Lab, she seeks to future-proof communities, governments and companies in light of the rapid shifts caused by new technologies. She has been working with the Mexican Government and digital ecosystem to carry out pilot projects and draft policy recommendations that place the country in a position of global leadership. For instance, she coordinated and co-authored Mexico's National AI Agenda published in 2020 and is currently working with the IDB to help protect children's data online, given the rushed transition of schools to online platform due to the pandemic, and with Facebook, the IDB and Mexican regulators to prototype public policy for more transparent and explainable AI systems in Mexico. She has her own TedX talk and was named a NextGen leader by the Aspen Institute and Microsoft. In the past, Claudia worked in IBM Germany. She graduated in International Business from the University of Warwick in the UK.
