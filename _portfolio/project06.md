Dr. Jessica Hamrick is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind, where she studies how to build machines that can flexibly build and deploy models of the world. Her work combines insights from cognitive science with structured relational architectures, model-based deep reinforcement learning, and planning. She has led workshops at major machine learning conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, as well as a tutorial on model-based RL at ICML 2020. In addition to her work at the intersection of AI and cognitive science, Dr. Hamrick has contributed to various open-source scientific computing projects including Jupyter and psiTurk. Dr. Hamrick completed her PhD in Psychology at UC Berkeley in Tom Griffiths’ Computational Cognitive Science Lab. Before that, she researched intuitive physics in Josh Tenenbaum’s Computational Cognitive Science Group at MIT.
