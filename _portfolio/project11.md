Dr. Shirley Ho leads the Cosmology X Data Science Group in the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute where she works with a wonderful group of international collaborators. She is also a research professor at New York University and an associate (adjunct) professor in the Dept. of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. Ho's research interests have ranged from using machine learning and statistics to tackle fundamental challenges in cosmology to accelerating simulations using deep learning. She has broad expertise in theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy and data science. Ho’s recent focus has been on understanding and developing novel tools in deep learning techniques, and applying them to astrophysical challenges. Her goal is to understand the universe’s beginning, evolution and ultimate fate.
