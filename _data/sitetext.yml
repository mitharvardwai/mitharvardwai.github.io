    title: "about us"
    text: >
      We are a club of MIT and Harvard students who are interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Beginners and interested individuals with any level of knowledge are welcome!
      
      We use an inclusive definition of the word women, and the purpose of the Women in Artificial Intelligence group is to provide a supportive community for cisgender women, transgender women, genderqueer women and individuals, and non-binary individuals pursuing studies or research in AI and machine learning at MIT and Harvard.

      We are structured formally as a reading group, meeting every other week to discuss papers of interest related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Additionally, we endeavor to serve as an organizing body to get more women involved in AI and ML, working with MIT and Harvard faculty to host more female speakers for machine intelligence-related seminars.
